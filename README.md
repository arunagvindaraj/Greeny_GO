# Greeny_GO
The proposed GREENY_GO voice-assistance app maintains a crop repository for the warehouses and farmers to monitor the quality and quantity of stored crops which helps in suggesting crop plantation using ML.  This in turn boosts the profit of farmers through high yield and price normalization.  In order to reduce agricultural wastage, the QR code is generated for the crops stored in warehouses that notifies the farmers to evacuate goods at right time and in addition shelf life of crops is monitored by temperature and humidity sensors.  Logistics are shared between farmers, warehouse and buyers for the transportation so that items can be easily transferred and directly delivered to the customers in an efficient cost.  IVRS system to make the app user friendly for farmer.  screenshots of the app has been uploaded for reference.
